## Abstract

This lab note introduces the "Stokes Camera," a simple and novel experimental arrangement for real-time measurement of spatial amplitude and polarisation, leading to spatially resolved Stokes parameters. This setup uses a polarisation sensitive camera combined with a fixed quarter-wave plate. This offers a one-shot, digital solution for polarisation measurement that mainly depends on the camera's frame rate and the computation speed of the associated code. Moreover, this document provides background information on relevant polarisation theory and vector vortex beams, employed as an exemplification of the device's capabilities.
